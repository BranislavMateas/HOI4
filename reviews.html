                            impressionistically, and perhaps a little amorally—it lets me 
                            orchestrate the most titanic armed struggles in history, from the

                            armchair-general game. The biggest problems I can point to are almost 
                            all performance-related, putting a slow, frustrating finale on what is 
                            otherwise an ingeniously detailed strategic stimulation of just about 
                            every aspect of 20th-century global warfare. I long for a way to 
                            extract more meaningful, personal stories and tactical feedback out 
                            of the hundreds of battles, but rarely did I ever feel like I was 
                            lacking for some weighty decision to make or interesting puzzle to put 
                            my mind to. This one’s well worth the extensive time investment required 
                            to learn how to manipulate its myriad moving parts into a well-oiled 
                            engine of war. Hearts of Iron 4 wields complexity like a swift armor 
                            division during the blitzkrieg, allowing it to serve the idea of 
                            layered, cerebral, strategic warfare instead of letting it needlessly 
                            bog down the experience."

                            itself from competitors by focusing on the stories of the people behind

                        Easily the best strategy game available right now. Lacked a bit of depth at release, but 
                        the two DLCs have been great. Hundreds of hours of potential, and even more in multiplayer. 
                        Absolutely recommended if you like strategy games. Graphics are great too, though the 32-bit 
                        single core engine is a bit of a letdown.

                        The game was quite good but not as good as Crusader Kings 2. The game is about World War 2, 
                        which there are a hell lot of games about, making Hearts of Iron 4 very cliche, the game 
                        has a huge learning curve, which can make a lot of players quit. But other than that, Hearts 
                        Of Iron 4 is a brillian game.

                        it's a great grand strategy mixed with sandbox, alternate history (if you want to), accurate 
                        history (again optional) and actual balanced game play the only downside of it is the lag and 
                        stuttering that happens when there's a lot happening in the game and the game is calculating.
